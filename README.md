# 👋 Hi friends, I'm Sujith 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about technology and constantly working on enhancing my skills.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **JavaScript** and **C-Programming**, building a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development.
- 💻 Continuously improving my **Web Development** skills, focusing on creating responsive, user-friendly websites and web applications.
- 👨‍💻 I worked on the **Automatic Targeting Military Radar Vehicle** project during my 2nd year engineering studies, which won the 🥈 **runner-up position** at the "Make a Product" event. This project helped soldiers by incorporating radar and camera-based targeting systems.
- 🏆 I completed my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**, where I gained experience in the **Web Development** domain, learning best practices in designing and building web applications.
- 🔗 Check out my project on [Login Webpage Design](https://github.com/sujith142003/Login-Webpage-Design-) where I explored different design and coding techniques.
